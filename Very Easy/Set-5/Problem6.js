/**
*   ---- Flip the Boolean ----

    Due to a programming concept known as truthiness, certain values can be evaluated to (i.e. take the place of) booleans. For example, 1 (or any number other than 0) is often equivalent to true, and 0 is often equivalent to false.

    Create a function that returns the opposite of the given boolean, as a number.

    Examples =>
        flipBoolean(true) ➞ 0
        flipBoolean(false) ➞ 1
        flipBoolean(1) ➞ 0
        flipBoolean(0) ➞ 1

    Notes =>
        - Don't forget to return the result.

/**
 Write a function that returns true if a year is a leap, otherwise return false.

    A year is a "leap year" if it lasts 366 days, instead of 365 in a typical year. That extra day is added to the end of the shortest month, creating February 29.

    A leap year occurs every four years, and will take place if the year is a multiple of four. The exception to this is a year at the beginning of a century (for example, 1900 or 2000), where the year must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

    Look at the examples, and if you need help, look at the resources panel.

    Examples:
        isLeapYear(2000) ➞ true
        isLeapYear(1900) ➞ false
        isLeapYear(2016) ➞ true
        isLeapYear(2017) ➞ false
        isLeapYear(1800) ➞ false
    
    Hint =>
        - Use the modulus operator to check if a year is a multiple of 4.
